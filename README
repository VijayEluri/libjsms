About:
------
Java library sending "short messages" (alias SMS) using free web service of your 
mobile provider. Currently only Sunrise Swiss mobile provider is supported, but feel free 
to add your provider's web interface.

There are is swisssms for OS X [1] in C# and Java Swing GUI SwissSMSCient [2], but I just 
wanted to have a small library in Java, which can be used to send SMS' by scripting or 
building a GUI based on it, whatever you like.

I used Apache's Maven. The Project site is http://www.renemoser.net/projects/ and http://github.com/resmo/libjsms

[1] http://code.google.com/p/swisssms/
[2] http://code.google.com/p/swisssmsclient/ 

Usage as external lib:
----------------------
import net.renemoser.libjsms.service.*;

try {
	ShortMessageService Sunrise = new Sunrise();
    Sunrise.doLogin(userid, password);
    Sunrise.sendShortMessage(phoneNumber, message);
    if (!Sunrise.getShortMessage().isEmpty()) {
    	System.out.println("Message '" + 
    	Sunrise.getShortMessage() + 
    	"' was sent to " + 
    	Sunrise.getPhoneNumber());
    }
} catch(Exception e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}

Usage as standalone:
--------------------
java -cp net.renemoser.libjsms.App <userid> <password> <phoneNumber> <message>
